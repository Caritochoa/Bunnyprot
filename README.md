This app has two basic routes “/” and “/mixed”:
In “/” calls the Data from Torrebio and replicates the profile page.

The second “/mixed” brings from Linkedin Api two features,
"Tu panel" and at the end Certifications.

I was able to get data from Torrebios Api, but with Linkedin was taking to long
so I decided to move forward in order to complete the test.
To solve this problem I created a Json server from where I called
the relevant data for the features.

Please have in mind when you click the button IMPORT FROM LINKEDIN
the first feature loads under the Fold, remember to scroll down to visualize
the imported features.
And to return to the Torrebio profile the link CAROLINA takes you there.

To interact with The app

$clone the Repo.
$ npm install react-router-dom
\$npm start.
